## Specific Aims
Goal-directed behavior requires the ability to rapidly and flexibly change behavior based on context (task switching). Behavior that is appropriate in one context is often inappropriate in another. The prefrontal cortex is necessary for supporting context-dependent behavior --- prefrontal lesions result in perseverative, context-inappropriate behavior [@stuss_neuropsychological_1984] and neurons in prefrontal cortex reflect context and behavioral responses [@wallis_single_2001] --- but little is known about the circuit and cellular mechanisms that enable flexibility.

Previous studies suggest that two subdivisions of the prefrontal cortex, the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) play functionally distinct, complementary roles in enabling the mapping of context to behavior. The prevailing model, based on studies of neural activity in human and rhesus macaque monkeys, asserts the dlPFC is responsible for maintaining and biasing attention to context-relevant sensorimotor information and the ACC is responsible for determining and adjusting the amount of attention needed for a given context [@shenhav_expected_2013]. This model predicts that in situations where more attention is needed --- such as when the expected value of meeting task demands increases [@shenhav_expected_2013] or when unexpected outcomes occur [@alexander_medial_2011] --- coordination increases within and between ACC and dlPFC to maintain or adjust the link between relevant sensory information and the appropriate response. However, scant evidence for such coordination exists --- particularly at the cellular and circuit level. Therefore, we propose to investigate this model, using multi-electrode electrophyisological recordings in the macaque monkey, by completing the following aims:

**Specific [Aim \#1](#aim1): To identify circuit-level coordination within and between ACC and dlPFC during task switching.** Phase coherence is a potential mechanism by which groups of neurons communicate at the circuit-level [@fries_mechanism_2005]. We hypothesize that phase coherence of local field potentials (LFPs) within and between dlPFC and ACC (1) is context-dependent and (2) increases when more attention is needed during the task, such as when the context changes or errors occur in the previous trial.

**Specific [Aim \#2](#aim2): To understand the functional contribution of ACC and dlPFC neurons to circuit-level dynamics and behavior during task switching.** Specifically, we will investigate the context selectivity of individual neurons in relation to (1) attentionally-demanding task factors, (2) population firing rates of ACC and dlPFC, and (3) behavior. If successful, this aim will show the specific contributions of ACC and DLPFC neurons to behavioral performance and their relationship to circuit level dynamics.

**Specific [Aim \#3](#aim3): To build web-enabled interactive visualization tools that enhance exploratory analysis, checking of raw data and statistical modeling assumptions, and data presentation for large, complex and multi-scale electrophyisological data.** In particular, these tools will allow for rapid multi-dimensional investigation of task-dependent neural dynamics over time at the single neuron and circuit-level.

Taken together, these combined aims provide an integrated view of the circuit level and cellular mechanisms in prefrontal cortex that contribute to flexible behavior. Our approach is innovative because we consider novel mechanisms for coordination of neural activity related to context within the prefrontal cortex and investigate a large collection of multi-dimensional models for ACC and dlPFC activity, which is enabled by our interactive visualization tools.
