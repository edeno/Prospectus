[Aim \#2](#aim2) had preliminary results appear in two Society for Neuroscience (SFN) posters (abstracts available [here][1] and [here][2]), but final results are still in progress.

[Aim \#3](#aim3) is 66% completed with Github repositories and functioning prototypes for all three proposed visualizations (see [SpectraVis](https://github.com/edeno/SpectraVis), [RasterVis](https://github.com/edeno/RasterVis), and [glmVis](https://github.com/edeno/glmVis)) and a rough draft of the thesis chapter (included in submitted materials).
