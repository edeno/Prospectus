## Project Summary
The overall goal of this research is to elucidate the cellular and circuit mechanisms underlying flexible behavior in the prefrontal cortex. We are often faced with situations in which the appropriate behavior in one context is inappropriate in others. If these situations are familiar, we can perform the appropriate behavior without relearning how the context relates to the behavior --- an important hallmark of intelligence. Neuroimaging and lesion studies have shown that this dynamic, flexible process of remapping context to behavior (task switching) is dependent on prefrontal cortex, but the precise contributions and interactions of prefrontal subdivisions are still controversial.

This project investigates two prefrontal areas that are thought to be involved in distinct, but complementary executive roles in task switching --- the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Using existing electrophysiological recordings from macaque monkeys, [Aim \#1](#aim1) will determine the impact of coherent network oscillations on context representations (rules) and whether they provide a mechanism for flexibly coordinating groups of neurons during task switching. [Aim \#2](#aim2) will use the same dataset to compare how rule representations are changed at the cellular level when more control is needed. Finally, [Aim \#3](#aim3) will develop a set of web-enabled interactive visualization tools designed to provide a multi-dimensional integrated view of the dataset. Results from this study will contribute to our understanding of task switching by investigating new mechanisms for coordination of neurons in prefrontal cortex and providing visualization tools that enhance exploration and understanding of large, complex and multi-scale electrophysiology data.
